## Notes

### Introduction

- Ari dismissed crypto in 2011 because not backed </br>
- Ari bought first Bitocin in 2014 </br>
- Really dove into crypto 2016 </br>

Ari - "For Crypto you kinda gotta know a little bit about a lot of things" 

- Got involved with crypto through crypto twitter </br>
**Cunningham's Law** - "The fastest way to get an answer on the internet is not to ask a question, but to state something wrong"

### Ari's Headspace 

- Long term mostly thinking about the future of crypto </br>
- BlockTower bets on where the world will be in 1-3 years, not 10-20 years </br>
- Fascinated by the big picture
- Huge believer in giving people defensive tools for overbearing states

### VC

- BlockTower is a trading firm by nature, so they invest in projects that they can actually be power users in

Ari - "Evaluating seed stage teams is its own skillset, very different from evaluating something like Microsoft"

- Cobie skeptical of a16z's success in crypto, followed like 4 deals they did and got crushed
- A lot of the time, timing is much more important than vetting skill

Ari - "If you were trading NFTs 2 years ago, it almost doesn't matter if you were good it just matters that you were doing it" 

### Privacy 

- Countries can control the internet very easily
- People think the internet is super hard to control - there is literally a bundle of wires that delivers the internet to an entire country

Ari - "There's a whole tech stack for privacy that's missing...zk-rollup chains where you can shield the mempool ... there is some super cool math we're building into the system now that could change everything" 

- You could fork Ethereum and add it as a rollup chain to Bitcoin

Ledger - "Is there really a market for that?"

Ari - "It seems likely in the next 2 years that we'll get a soft fork to implement this"

Ari - "There are bitcoiners who are pitching this as humanitarian technology but against adding privacy that exists ... borderline unethical"

### Ethereum 

- Ethereum is a risk startup competing on tech
- The odds it is a market leader in 10 years is under 20%
- Facebook didn't need a single Friendster user or dev
- If you have an industry that's going to 20x, you don't need to take existing useres

Ari - "Solana has something like more than 10,000 active developers now"

- Ethereum does not have much of a moat, it has a little bit of brand recognition, a little bit of regulatory head start, some dev moat, but largely the moat is very small
- Ethereum cannot move as fast, cannot take as much risk. It's hard to maintain its lead

Cobie - "Do you think Ethereum should have a canary network, kind of like Kusama?"

Ari - "I actually haven't thought about that"

- Seems to be a real, good idea

### Solana

- Ari has been recommending Solana for the last 2 years
- Well intentioned team, real project, very cool innovation at the communication layer
- DISCLAIMER: Ari has a long Solana position
- It's quite centralized depends on the team to stay up, has a real path to decentralization
- It's a highly speculative early stage bet

### BNB

- Exchange coins are basically sold as equities
- There are tons of regulatory actions which could likely be negative for $BNB
- Would not hold the coin

### Cardano

Ari - "Cardano I actually know very little about"

- The only thing he really believed would stick around for 5 years was Bitcoin, DeFi and NFTs

Ari - "I worry that in 5-10 years the winning metaverse will be Facebook or Fortnite, some centralized entity, which scares me because I want a decentralized world"

Ledger - "so Cardano"

Ari - "I am deeply skeptical of Cardano"

Ledger - "Dump it"

### 2017 Bull Market

- Ari bought $50k calls in 2017 
- Did it to maintain upside exposure while not keeping material risk on
- Went onto CNBC to talk about it, they mid-curved his thinking

Ari - "Options are a bet on volatility, not the direction, because you can always hedge the direction with the underlying. If you can't define skew and kurtosis then you probably shouldn't be trading options"

### Crypto investing

Ari - "If you're investing with a lot of small bets in alts, it almost acts as a call option"

- Ari thinks vol is about fair today
- Basically every time BItcoin vol gets below 60, Ari buys it

Ari - "The crazier the bull market the crazier the retrace."<br>
"My basic thesis now is DeFi 5-10x's here and then retraces 80-90%"<br>
"The biggest value add from crypto over the next 12-18 months is connecting DeFi to real world lending"

### Final Alpha

Ari - "It doesn't matter how much money you make, if you don't keep yourself healthy you won't enjoy it"

- Focuse on your health!
