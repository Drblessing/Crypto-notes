## Notes

### Introduction
- Path has never had a job 

Ledger - "You basically went from being a child to retired"

- Ledge wants to bring Teen Executive back on to teach him a lesson
- Path bought Bitcoin on the run-up in 2013 around $100
- Went to $250 then dropped to $50 in 3 days
- Largest red candle ever? 80%?

### 2014 Alt Coins

- Feathercoin, BlackCoin
- Ledger bought BlackCoin in 2017 lmao
- BlackCoin was the best pump cause it ripped like 10x, then WhiteCoin pumped right after
- Do not hold something longer than the 1st pump

### Path’s Convictions

- Had a lot of ETH back in the day but sold early
- Then, built a large position in the 2019 bear market

Path - "High fees are bullish"

- For Ethereum, you're paying for the security
- A lot of volume will shift to layer 2 in the coming years

### Zcash

- Path was high conviction ZEC early on
- It has really been down only since then
- Zooko (Zcash creator) mentioned in the white paper
- Military very interested in Zk-SNARKs for 60 IQ newbs, Zk-SNARK = Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge
Tezos
- Path fudded Tezos a bit for NFTs back in May
- The founder quote-tweeted him and got pissed

Path - "Tezos as an investment isn't great really" <br> "Tezos is definitely the second-best chain for NFTs after ETH"

Chat - "How can you say Tezos is the second-best NFT chain when Solana exists?"

Path - "Tezos has actual art!" he likes the art

### NFTs
- CryptoKitties took off 2017 peaks
- Rare Pepes were even before that
- CryptoPunks prob still a great buy
- Axie Infinity is paying people more than minimum wage in their countries

Path - "Axie Infinity is only the first one of these metaverse games"
<br> "Save your money and wait for the big collections to come along"
<br> "Eventually all artists will come to NFTs, even if they hate it now"

- 1/1s have performed very well
- MekaVerse is the biggest NFT drop maybe ever, comes out in 45 min

### NFD

- Path fractionalized the fiesty DOGE picture
- Now has a market cap of 8,700 ETH ($31M)
  - that's a very profitable day
- PleasrDAO fractionalized the original DOGE picture
- Bought for $4M, now worth $250M
- Cobie: "Why is dog money a thing at all?"
- It shows that memes have real value

Cobie - "It's pretty cool how Sam is the richest person under 30 and he just replies to your DMs and tweets"


### Trading

Cobie - "Do you still trade or are you just a collectooor?"

Path - "I've been trading still, mostly NFTs"
- Still likes Bitcoin, longer ETH
- ETH will go sideways before $4k, then in a month or two you lever up on a dip and watch it rip
- Bitcoin probably runs first, then others after 

Path - "ETH chart looks good… going to $20k easy"
<br> "This is the supercycle, I don't think these bleed out anymore"

### Urbit

- Been in development since 2002
- Your ID is locked to a planet or star
- You can buy planets, stars, and galaxies
- It's all about decentralizing everything and not being at the mercy of Microsoft or Apple or anything

Path - "It's a great idea, it's a really interesting idea" <br>
"This is the next big thing after NFTs and metaverse and stuff, you guys will be on this in like 5 years"
